# League-of-Legends-YoloV5-Training-Images-Generator

A simple C# Tool that allows you to easily generate League of Legends Training Images for YoloV5.

This tool uses the minimap champion icon image from each champ and an in-game minimap image, places the champion icon image at a random position on the minimap image, merges these two images into one image and saves it together with an .xml label file so you don't have to manually label each image anymore. 
Thus you can generate several hundreds of labeled images for each champion on the minimap.
